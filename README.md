<h2 align="left">ü§î What is Blurify.AI?</h2>
<p align="justify">Blurify.AI is a web-based application that allows you to upload an image and detect and blur all faces within that image. 
The project was built using the <b>YOLO v8</b> and <b>HaarCascade Classifier</b> object detection algorithms and Streamlit framework. 
The application can be used to anonymize faces in images, preserving privacy and confidentiality. It can also be used for 
creative purposes such as adding a blur effect to a portrait.</p>

<br>

<h2 align="left">üî® How was it built?</h2>
<p align="justify">Blurify.AI was built using the <b>YOLO v8</b> and <b>HaarCascade Classifier</b> object detection algorithms and 
Streamlit web framework. The YOLO v8 algorithm is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that is highly 
accurate and efficient. Streamlit is a popular web framework that allows you to quickly build and deploy 
web-based applications using Python. The project was trained on a dataset of faces to detect and blur 
faces in images uploaded by the user. </p>

1. Clone the repository by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/baselhusam/Blurify.AI.gi
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages by running the following command:
``` python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the application by running the following command:
```python

<br>

<h2 align="left">üöÄ How to use it?</h2>

<p align="justify">Using Blurify.AI is simple and easy. Simply follow the steps below:</p>

1. Deploy the web-app locally with the previous steps.

2. Click on the "Upload Image" button and select an image from your device.

3. Click on the "Blurify" button.

4. Wait for the algorithm to detect and blur faces in the image.

5. Download the blurred image by right click and select "Save image as".

<p align="justify">That's it! Your image is now blurred and ready to use.</p>
